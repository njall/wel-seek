= JERM (Just Enough Results Model)

The JERM (Just Enough Results Model) allows us to exchange, interpret and compare between different types of data and results files across SysMO.

== Harvesting

The term harvesting is what we use to describe the mechanism for interacting with remote data stores and importing, or registering, the assets
contained there within Sysmo SEEK.

There are 3 key components that need to be concidered if you wish to produce your own Harvester. You can find more details of each by reading the code
documentation contained within those files.

<em>Please note that these components are under active development and their interfaces are liable to change.</em>

* Jerm::Harvester - This is the class responsible for interacting directly with the remote site and producing a collection of Jerm::Resources ready for insertion into SEEK.
  You wil need to implement you own version to map to your Data storage system.
* Jerm::Resource - This provides a light-weight description the resource to be registered with SEEK.
* Jerm::Populator - This is the base responsible for registering the new asset within SEEK.
  The current implementation of this is the Jerm::EmbeddedPopulator which interacts directly with ActiveModel and has to run within the SEEK rails application.
  A planned future implementation is the Jerm::RestfulPopulator that interacts with the SEEK Rest iterface and can run external to the SEEK rails application.
