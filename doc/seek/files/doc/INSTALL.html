      <h1>Installing SEEK</h1>
<p>
SEEK is based upon the Ruby on Rails platform. Although the information on
this page should provide you with everything you need to get a basic
installation of SEEK up and running, some background reading on Ruby on
Rails would be beneficial if it is new to you. Documentation and resources
describing Ruby on Rails can be found at <a
href="http://rubyonrails.org/documentation">rubyonrails.org/documentation</a>.
Since SEEK uses v2.3.8 of Rails, <a
href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8">guides.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8</a>/
and <a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8">api.rubyonrails.org/v2.3.8</a> may
be useful as well.
</p>
<p>
We recommend that you run SEEK on a Linux system. All of the examples here
describe installing on an Ubuntu (10.04 LTS) or Debian system, but should
be easily transferrable to other Linux systems such as Fedora. There is a
script for CentOS that was contributed to us by Mark Woodbridge (Imperial
College, London) available at <a
href="https://gist.github.com/2127663">gist.github.com/2127663</a>
</p>
<p>
Although possible, installing and running Ruby on Rails on a Windows system
is troublesome and is not covered here.
</p>
<h2>Prerequesites</h2>
<p>
We recommend you use ruby, version 1.8.7.
</p>
<p>
The steps in the next section outline the commands required to install all
the required packages for Ubuntu or Debian.
</p>
<p>
MySQL server needs to be installed installed, along the development package
(required to compile the MySQL rubygem). We use the Ubuntu/Debian packages
<em>mysql-server</em> and <em>libmysqlclient15-dev</em>
</p>
<p>
The ImageMagick libraries need to be installed, as these are required by
the rmagic gem. We use the The Ubuntu/Debian package
<em>libmagick++9-dev</em>
</p>
<p>
You will need a minimal build environment, as some of the ruby gems require
compilation. The Ubuntu/Debian package <em>build-essentials</em> should be
sufficient
</p>
<p>
SEEK uses Lucene as its search engine, and this requires that java is
installed. Sun Java is no longer available for Ubuntu, but OpenJDK should
work fine.
</p>
<p>
Before starting, its a good idea to get up to date:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get -y upgrade
</pre>
<p>
The following commands will install the core required packages:
</p>
<p>
for Ubuntu Precise 12.04 (LTS):
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install wget mercurial ruby ri1.8 libruby1.8 ruby-dev mysql-server libssl-dev build-essential openssh-server
  sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev libmagick++-dev libxslt1-dev libxml++2.6-dev openjdk-6-jdk graphviz libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
</pre>
<p>
for Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 (LTS):
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install wget mercurial ruby rdoc ri libopenssl-ruby ruby-dev mysql-server libssl-dev build-essential openssh-server
  sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16-dev libmagick++-dev libxslt-dev libxml++2.6-dev openjdk-6-jdk graphviz libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
</pre>
<p>
If setting up for production deployment using the <a
href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger Phusion (modrails)</a> module you
can save a step later by also using:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
</pre>
<p>
You now need to install rubygems (1.3.7). Rather than install through
apt-get, we recommend downloading and installing from the rubygems website:
<a
href="http://rubygems.org/pages/download">rubygems.org/pages/download</a>.
The following commands should install rubygems for you on a Ubuntu/Debian
system.
</p>
<pre>
  cd /tmp
  wget http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
  tar zfxv rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
  cd rubygems-1.3.7/
  sudo ruby ./setup.rb
  cd /usr/bin/
  sudo ln -s gem1.8 gem
  cd -
</pre>
<h2>Getting the source code</h2>
<p>
On a production server we would recommend installing into the directory
<em>/srv/rails/</em> and installing as the user www-data. There is also
more information later on how to setup Apache and <a
href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger Phusion (modrails)</a>.
</p>
<p>
Our source code is stored within the <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/sysmo-db/">Sysmo-DB Google Code
Repository</a>, using <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>
as the version control system.
</p>
<p>
For a stable version, you should check out according to a stable tag. Our
current stable tag is <em>0.14.1</em>, so to retrieve this version you
should use:
</p>
<pre>
  hg clone https://sysmo-db.googlecode.com/hg/ -r v0.14.1 seek
</pre>
<p>
This will create a <em>seek</em> directory that contains the application.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> is used to manage gems, so to
install the required gems you first need to install the bundler gem:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo gem install -d bundler rake
</pre>
<p>
Then from within the seek directory run
</p>
<pre>
  bundle install
</pre>
<p>
If you are requested for a root or sudo password, but you do not have this
level of access then you should use
</p>
<pre>
  bundle install --deployment
</pre>
<h2>The RAILS_ENV environment variable</h2>
<p>
If you are setting up SEEK as a production environment, rather than for
development, you should set the RAILS_ENV variable before proceeding
</p>
<pre>
  export RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>
<h2>Configuring the database</h2>
<p>
Copy config/database.default.yml to config/database.yml and edit
accordingly - either MySQL or SQLite3 should work (you will need to install
the <em>sqlite3-dev</em> package and the <em>sqlite3-ruby</em> gem)
</p>
<p>
To add users to the MySQL database, first login to the database as an
administrator (root by default) and issue a GRANT command along the lines
of the example below (for clarity, this uses a username of
<em>mysqluser</em> and password <em>mysqlpassword</em>. <b>You are
obviously recommended to use a different username and password</b> on a
server exposed to the internet).
</p>
<pre>
    &gt; mysql -uroot -p
    Enter password:
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 1522
    Server version: 5.1.37-1ubuntu5.1 (Ubuntu)

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    mysql&gt; CREATE USER 'mysqluser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mysqlpassword';
    mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
</pre>
<p>
Run the rake database setup task, this creates the database, loads the
schema and seeds the database with any default data
</p>
<pre>
  bundle exec rake db:setup
</pre>
<h2>Starting Delayed-Job (Background processing)</h2>
<p>
Some background processing is handled using a tool called <em>Delayed
Job</em>, and it is essential this is running for SEEK to behave correctly.
</p>
<p>
To start delayed job run the script
</p>
<pre>
  ./script/delayed_job start
</pre>
<p>
or for production:
</p>
<pre>
  RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
</pre>
<p>
For production servers, we recommend setting up an init.d script to
automatically start and stop delayed_job. An example script can be found
at: <a href="https://gist.github.com/3169625">gist.github.com/3169625</a>
Put this script in /etc/init.d/, called maybe seek-delayed-job, and edit
the APP_PATH accordingly. Then run
</p>
<pre>
  sudo update-rc.d seek-delayed-job defaults
</pre>
<p>
You can then start and stop delayed job using:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo service seek-delayed-job start
</pre>
<p>
and
</p>
<pre>
  sudo service seek-delayed-job stop
</pre>
<h2>Starting the server</h2>
<p>
You can now start the server with the command
</p>
<pre>
  ./script/server
</pre>
<p>
If running in production mode, you should start the server with
</p>
<pre>
  ./script/server -e production
</pre>
<h2>Creating the Admin user</h2>
<p>
Once the server is running you should visit the page <a
href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>
</p>
<p>
If there are no users present in the system (and there should not be at
this stage) you will be requested to provide login details, and some basic
information about your profile (you can always come back and modify the
profile information and your password. You cannot modify your login name).
</p>
<p>
Once created this user will become the admin user of the system.
</p>
<h2>Administering the system</h2>
<p>
Once logged in as an administrator, you will notice a link on the
right-hand side of the tabs/search bar &quot;Admin Enabled&quot;. Selecting
this will provide you with some admin facilities for creating new projects,
institutions and profiles; defining additional administrators; or modifying
the behaviour of SEEK.
</p>
<p>
Some of the key settings required for a new installation are described in
the following sections.
</p>
<h2>Enabling search and starting the Sunspot SOLR server</h2>
<p>
Search can be enabled in the admin setting under Admin settings, Site
configuration, Enable/disable features - under &quot;Search enabled&quot;.
You will need to restart the server after changing this setting.
</p>
<p>
To start the search server you need to run:
</p>
<pre>
  bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
</pre>
<p>
and to reindex any existing data that created before search was enabled:
</p>
<pre>
  bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:reindex
</pre>
<p>
If you want Sunspot SOLR to start automatically whenever you restart the
machine SEEK is running on, you probably want to create an init.d/ script.
A script we use is available at <a
href="https://gist.github.com/3143434">gist.github.com/3143434</a> (the
APP_PATH may need changing for you)
</p>
<p>
On Ubuntu or Debian, after putting the script in init.d/ you should run
(assuming you called he file seek-solr)
</p>
<pre>
  sudo update-rc.d seek-solr defaults
</pre>
<p>
You can then start the service with
</p>
<pre>
  service seek-solr start
</pre>
<p>
.. and stop with
</p>
<pre>
  service seek-solr stop
</pre>
<h2>Configuring BioPortal</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org/">BioPortal</a> is a service used
in SEEK for supporting and searching ontologies, which we communicate with
via its API. However, the API requires an api-key that we are unable to
distribute with SEEK. To be able to link organisms with NCBI terms, or
search for organisms when defining new ones, an api-key has to be setup. We
also have future plans for more widespread uses of ontologies - such as for
the Experiment and Technology types, and for tagging with semantic terms.
</p>
<p>
To get an api-key you first need to register with BioPortal at <a
href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org/accounts/new">bioportal.bioontology.org/accounts/new</a>,
and once registred and logged in your api-key should be shown under Account
details. More information is available at <a
href="http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/BioPortal_REST_services">www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/BioPortal_REST_services</a>.
</p>
<p>
In SEEK, you apply the BioPortal api-key under the Admin-&gt;Site
Configuration-&gt;Additional Settings.
</p>
<h2>Configuring DOI and PubMed search</h2>
<p>
To be able to support adding publications using a <a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">PubMed</a> ID or DOI to your SEEK
installation, you need to do 2 things.
</p>
<ul>
<li>For PubMed you simply need to add your email address under Admin-&gt;Site
Configuration-&gt;Additional Settings

</li>
<li>For DOI - you need to register your email address with <a
href="http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> at <a
href="http://www.crossref.org/requestaccount">www.crossref.org/requestaccount</a>/
and then provide that email to SEEK under Admin-&gt;Site
Configuration-&gt;Additional Settings

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up Passenger Phusion and Apache for production servers.</h2>
<p>
This section is only relevant if setting up a production deployment, and
assumes that seek has been deployed to /srv/rails/seek as the user
www-data, and that you have used RAILS_ENV=production whilst setting up.
Most of these steps are already very well documented at <a
href="http://www.modrails.com/install.html">Passenger Phusion Install
Guide</a> and the installation is a guided process.
</p>
<p>
If you have not done so already, then beforehand install some additional
libaries using:
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
</pre>
<p>
Next install the passenger gem
</p>
<pre>
  sudo gem install passenger
</pre>
<p>
Next run the following command to compile and install the modrails Apache
modules, and follow the instructions it provides
</p>
<pre>
  sudo passenger-install-apache2-module
</pre>
<p>
If you&#8216;ve followed the instructions, you will have added something
like the following (the version numbers may differ) to your
<em>/etc/apache/http.conf</em>
</p>
<pre>
  LoadModule passenger_module /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-3.0.7/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
  PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-3.0.7
  PassengerRuby /usr/bin/ruby1.8
</pre>
<p>
and configured a virtual host (probably in
<em>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default</em>) that looks something like:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
     ServerName www.yourhost.com
     DocumentRoot /srv/rails/seek/public
        &lt;Directory /srv/rails/seek/public&gt;
         AllowOverride all
         Options -MultiViews
      &lt;/Directory&gt;
   &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>
When setting up a production server, it is recommended that init.d/ scripts
are added for delayed job, and sunspot. See the delayed job and Sunspot
sections above for instructions on how to do this.
</p>
<h2>Rebranding SysMO SEEK for other projects</h2>
<p>
If you are running SEEK for a project other than SysMO you can change
various text elements under Admin-&gt;Site Configuration-&gt;Site branding.
</p>
<p>
To insert your application/project name into the help documents for SEEK,
and to remove the logos/links to SEEK&#8216;s &#8216;related projects and
friends&#8217; use
</p>
<pre>
  bundle exec rake seek:rebrand
</pre>
<p>
If you only want to change the help documents, you can instead use
</p>
<pre>
  bundle exec rake seek:rebrand_help_docs
</pre>
<h2>Backing up</h2>
<p>
Please read our <a href="BACKUPS.html">Backup Guide</a> for suggestions on
how to backup a SEEK installation.
</p>
<h2>Contacting us and other developers</h2>
<p>
There is a public Google Group available for SEEK development at <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/seek-development">groups.google.com/group/seek-development</a>
